        <h1>University of Guelph - Workterm Report S20 </h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        I'm headed into my third year studying Computer Science with a minor in Marketing at the University of Guelph.
        This is a reccount of my first Co-op work term where I worked as a Website Support and Migration Specialist for the University of Guelph. 
        </p>

        <h2>About the University of Guelph - CCS (WDS)</h2>
        <p>I was employed by the CCS (Computing Communication Services) specifically the Web Development Solutions 
            department of the University of Guelph. They oversee web development and assist clients and stakeholders across the University
            in creating and maintaing their websites.
        </p>

        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <p>
            My main responsibility for the summer was creating a new website that was the merger of the BFPO and IAR departments into a single site
            branded as IRP. I was responsible for the project management - interacting with clients, turing requirements into user stories,
            and managing the task board using the SCRUM methodology. I was also responsible for implementing and creating the website using the Drupal
            CMS and HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was also involved in other projects throughout the summer these included:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Assisting in the creation of the Spring Academic Open House website
                </li>

                <li>
                    Redesigning the Guelph International Landing page
                </li>

                <li>
                    The hiring process of a Fall Co-op student
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the workterm I developed 3 goals about what I wanted to takeaway from the summer.<br/> They were as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Improve my communication skills when it comes to interacting with clients. I want to be able to successfully 
                speak with clients to gather requirements and keep them informed on the work I am completing.
            </li>

            <li>Improve my front-end design skills. I want to be able to develop good looking sites that 
                have an attractive look and solid feel.
            </li>

            <li>Improve my ability to work in a SCRUM environment. I want to become comfortable 
                and work efficiently with this methodology.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Learnings/Reflections</h2>
        <p>I will begin with reflecting on my goals and then talk about learnings not related specifically to my goals</p>

        <p>For my first goal I wanted to focus on improving my communication with clients. I felt as if I accomplished this, 
            because of the nature of my project I was the only one working on it which meant I was responsibile for gathering requirements,
            aswell as demoing what I was working on to stake holders. I built a strong repor with the clients I was working with and they were
             very happy with the outcome and felt their input was represented extremely well. I also presented to four different directors of departments
             throughout my term.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my second goal I wanted to improve my Front-End design skills. I felt that I accomplished this, I asked my co-workers who had more experience
            countless questions about design and I was able to learn a lot. By the middle of the term I had created a new IRP landing page design, a
            Guelph International landing page design, and a new navigation design that were all approved and implemented.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my third goal I wanted to learn how to participate in a Scrum environment. I did this by contributing in the daily stand-ups,
            sprint planning, and sprint review/retrospective.
        </p>
